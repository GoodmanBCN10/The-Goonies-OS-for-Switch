# The-Goonies-OS-for-Switch
Clean Pack CFW with hekate, Atmosphere and DBI with essencial apps only

HOW TO INSTALL THE PACK

· With the console off, remove the microSD card and insert it into your PC. Delete all folders EXCEPT THE "emuMMC" and "Nintendo" folders (you may not have this one).
· Copy the entire contents of the PACK to the root of your console.


I left only 3 "disks" when you connect the console via DBI/Responder MTP.
The following will appear:
1: SD CARD
5: SD CARD INSTALL (Where you'll copy the games).
7: Saves
