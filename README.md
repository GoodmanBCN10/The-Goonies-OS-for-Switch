# The-Goonies-OS-for-Switch
Clean Pack CFW with hekate, Atmosphere and DBI with essencial apps only
PACK THE GOONIES OS / FIRMWARE PACK 20.5.0 / ATMOSPHERE 1.9.5 / DBI v810 (Spanish translate)

· Added "The Goonies" logo and "joy icon" boot logo, "Switch" boot sound

HOW TO INSTALL THE PACK

· With the console off, remove the microSD card and insert it into your PC. Delete all folders EXCEPT THE "emuMMC" and "Nintendo" folders (you may not have this one).
· Copy the entire contents of the PACK to the root of your console.

· The DBI v810 translate to spanish.

· If the "The Goonies" logo doesn't appear and you don't hear any sound when you start it, follow these steps:
  1. Restart the console. You'll be taken back to the "Launch" menu. Click X CLOSE.
  2. Click "Tools". Then, press Arch Bit (bottom right). Then press "Fix Archive Bit." It will take more or less time to do its job depending on the size and speed of your microSD card. When it's finished, a message will appear saying "Done! Archive bits fixed: XX (mine came in at 49) unset and 0 set" or something similar. Press X CLOSE.
3. Finally, press Home again and from "Launch" you can start.

I left only 4 "disks" when you connect the console via DBI/Responder MTP.
The following will appear:
1: SD CARD
5: SD CARD INSTALL (Where you'll copy the games).
7: Saves

Includes firmware 20.5.0 in case you haven't updated. Once you've updated, it's recommended to delete the "Firmware 20.5.0" folder from the microSD card.
